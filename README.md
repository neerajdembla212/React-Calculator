# React Caclulator

This project demonstrates how to create a react calculator without using `eval` as we all know eval can make our apps vulnerable to cross site scripting attacks.

## Upcoming features 
    1. Adding a history button to go through your past calculations. At the moment this app stores the calculations and displays in raw format also allows you to jump to a particular step. In future we will merge this in a single button on our calculator.
    2. Adding support for float values.
